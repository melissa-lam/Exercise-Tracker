# **My Fitness Tracker**

## **About This Project:**

*What will the application do?*
- This application will be a fitness tracker. It will track the types of exercises done, such as endurance, strength, 
balance, and flexibility. It will record the duration of time exercised in each area. It will also record the date so 
the user can input a date and look back on which exercises they did. Every exercise will be recorded under a particular
person's name. They can also set personal goals that they want to reach. After they reach this goal, it can be added to 
a list of goals they've completed. There will also be a leaderboard for users that will create incentive for exercising.
There will be a top 10 most goals reached and top 10 most hours exercised. 

*Who will use it?*
- This application will be useful for anyone who values their health and wants to focus on staying healthy. This can be 
students, fitness instructors, athletes, or anyone wishing to keep track of their workouts.

*Why is this project of interest to me?*
- This project interests me because as a student, I can find myself neglecting my health because of school commitments. 
I want to focus on having a healthy lifestyle this year through healthy eating and exercising. This project will help me
 focus on the physical health aspect of my goal.
