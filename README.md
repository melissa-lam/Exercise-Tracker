# **My Fitness Tracker**

## **About This Project:**

*What will the application do?*
- This application will be a fitness tracker. It will track the types of exercises done, such as endurance, strength, 
balance, and flexibility. It will record the duration of time exercised in each area in number of hours in integers. 
It will also record the date, so the user can input a date and look back on which exercises they did. You can also set 
personal goals that you want to reach. After they reach this goal, it can be added to 
a list of goals they've completed. You can view the list of goals left to do and list of goals you've already completed.

*Who will use it?*
- This application will be useful for anyone who values their health and wants to focus on staying healthy. This can be 
students, fitness instructors, athletes, or anyone wishing to keep track of their workouts.

*Why is this project of interest to me?*
- This project interests me because as a student, I can find myself neglecting my health because of school commitments. 
I want to focus on having a healthy lifestyle this year through healthy eating and exercising. This project will help me
 focus on the physical health aspect of my goal. I also want to make this for my dad so he can keep track of his 
 exercises and so that he can stay motivated in being healthy.
